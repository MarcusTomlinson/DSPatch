/**
A class that is required to run actions in a parallel thread can be derived from Thread in order to
inherit multi-threading abilities. The Start() method initiates a parallel thread and executes the
protected virtual Run_() method in that thread. The derived class must override this Run_() method
with one that executes the required parallel actions. Upon construction, the priority for the
created thread may be selected from the public enumeration: Priority.
