/// Thread class for ticking and reseting a single component

/**
A ComponentThread is responsible for ticking and reseting a single component continuously in a
free-running thread. Upon initialisation, a reference to the component must be provided for the
Thread's Run_() method to use. Once Start() has been called, the thread will begin repeatedly
executing the Run_() method. On each thread iteration, ComponentThread simply calls the reference
component's Tick() and Reset() methods.

The Pause() method causes ComponentThread to wait until instructed to Resume() again.
