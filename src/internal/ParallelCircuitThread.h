/// Thread class for asynchronously ticking parallel circuit components

/**
A ParallelCircuitThread is responsible for ticking parallel components within a Circuit. Upon initialisation, a reference to the
parallel-ordered vector of circuit components must be provided for the thread _Run() method to loop through. Each
ParallelCircuitThread has a buffer number (bufferNo) and thread number (threadNo), which is also provided upon initialisation.
When creating multiple ParallelCircuitThreads, each thread must have their own unique bufferNo:threadNo combination, beginning at
0:0 and incrementing for every buffer thread added. The buffer number corresponds with the Component's buffer number when calling
its Tick() method in the ParallelCircuitThread's component loop, and the thread number is that buffer's thread index - i.e. a
circuit with x threads, will spawn x threads per buffer.

The Sync() method will block until the thread is ready to process. The Resume() method will then signal the ParallelCircuitThread
to tick its components once, after which the thread will wait until instructed to resume again. As each component is done
processing it hands over control to the next waiting CircuitThread, therefore, from an external control loop (I.e. Circuit's
Tick() method) we can simply loop through our array of ParallelCircuitThreads twice, calling Sync() on each, then Resume() on
each.
