/// Thread class for asynchronously ticking circuit components

/**
A CircuitThread is responsible for ticking and reseting all components within a Circuit. Upon
initialisation, a reference to the vector of circuit components must be provided for the thread
_Run() method to loop through. Each CircuitThread has a thread number (threadNo), which is also
provided upon initialisation. When creating multiple CircuitThreads, each thread must have their
own unique thread number, beginning at 0 and incrementing by 1 for every thread added. This thread
number corresponds with the Component's buffer number when calling its Tick() and Reset() methods
in the CircuitThread's component loop. Hence, for every circuit thread created, each component's
buffer count within that circuit must be incremented to match.

The SyncAndResume() method causes the CircuitThread to tick and reset all circuit components once,
after which the thread will wait until instructed to resume again. As each component is done
processing it hands over control to the next waiting circuit thread, therefore, from an external
control loop (I.e. Circuit's Tick() method) we can simply loop through our array of CircuitThreads
calling SyncAndResume() on each. If a circuit thread is busy processing, a call to SyncAndResume()
will block momentarily until that thread is done processing.
