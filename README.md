# DSPatch
The C++ Flow-Based Programming Framework

Webite: http://flowbasedprogramming.com

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcusTomlinson/DSPatch.git
cd DSPatch
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

- *`cmake ..` will auto-detect your IDE / compiler. To manually select one, use `cmake -G`.*
- *When building for an IDE, instead of `make`, simply open the cmake generated project file.*

DSPatch, pronounced "dispatch", is a powerful C++ flow-based programming framework. DSPatch is not limited to any particular domain or data type, its generic, object-oriented API allows you to create almost any dataflow system imaginable, from simple logic circuits to high performance audio process chains.
