```
git clone https://github.com/cross-platform/DSPatch.git
cd DSPatch
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

- *`cmake ..` will auto-detect your IDE / compiler. To manually select one, use `cmake -G`.*
- *When building for an IDE, instead of `make`, simply open the cmake generated project file.*

DSPatch, pronounced "dispatch", is a powerful C++ dataflow framework. DSPatch is not limited to any particular domain or data type, from reactive programming to stream processing, DSPatch's generic, object-oriented API allows you to create virtually any dataflow system imaginable.
