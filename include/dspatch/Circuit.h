/// Workspace for adding and routing components

/**
Components can be added to a Circuit and routed to and from other Components. ConnectOutToIn and
DisconnectOutToIn provide a means of routing component outputs to other component inputs, while
ConnectInToIn / DisconnectInToIn and ConnectOutToOut / DisconnectOutToOut route the circuit's IO
signals to and from it's internal components.

*N.B. Each component input can only accept one wire at a time. When a wire is connected to an input
that already has a connected wire, that wire is replaced with the new one. One output, on the other
hand, can be distributed to multiple inputs.

For process intensive circuits, multi-threaded processing can be enabled via the SetThreadCount()
method. The Circuit class allows the user to specify the number of threads in which he/she requires
the circuit to process (0 threads: multi-threading disabled). A circuit's thread count can be
adjusted at runtime, allowing the user to increase / decrease the number of threads as required
during execution.

Circuit is derived from Component and therefore inherits all Component behavior. This means that a
Circuit can be added to, and routed within another Circuit as a component. This also means a
circuit object needs to be Tick()ed and Reset()ed as a component (see Component). The Circuit
Process_() method simply runs through it's internal array of components and calls each component's
Tick() and Reset() methods.
