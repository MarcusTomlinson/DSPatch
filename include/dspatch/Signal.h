/// Value container used to carry data between components

/**
Components process and transfer data between each other in the form of "signals" via interconnected
wires. The Signal class holds a single value that can be dynamically typed at runtime. Furthermore,
a Signal has the ability to change it's data type at any point during program execution. This is
designed such that a signal bus can hold any number of different typed variables, as well as to
allow for a variable to dynamically change it's type when needed - this can be useful for inputs
that accept a number of different data types (E.g. Varying sample size in an audio buffer: array of
byte / int / float).
