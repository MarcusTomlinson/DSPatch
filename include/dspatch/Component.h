/// Abstract base class for DSPatch components

/**
Classes derived from Component can be added to a Circuit and routed to and from other Components.

On construction, derived classes must configure the component's IO buses by calling
SetInputCount_() and SetOutputCount_() respectively.

Derived classes must also implement the virtual method: Process_(). The Process_() method is a
callback from the DSPatch engine that occurs when a new set of input signals is ready for
processing. The Process_() method has 2 arguments: the input bus, and the output bus. This method's
purpose is to pull its required inputs out of the input bus, process these inputs, and populate the
output bus with the results (see SignalBus).

In order for a component to do any work it must be ticked over. This is performed by repeatedly
calling the Tick() and Reset() methods. The Tick() method is responsible for acquiring the next set
of input signals from component input wires and populating the component's input bus. To insure
that these inputs are up-to-date, the dependent component first calls all of its input components'
Tick() methods - hence recursively called in all components going backward through the circuit
(This is what's classified as a "pull system"). The acquired input bus is then passed to the
Process_() method. The Reset() method then informs the component that the last circuit traversal
has completed and hence can execute the next Tick() request. A component's Tick() and Reset()
methods can be called in a loop from the main application thread, or alternatively, by calling
StartAutoTick(), a separate thread will spawn, automatically calling Tick() and Reset() methods
continuously (This is most commonly used to tick over an instance of Circuit).
